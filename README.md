# Java-Library-Database

Considering the management and maintenance of a "library database" in a certain school. It holds the information of material resources in use for students in that school. This information is recorded based on the object-oriented design. The skeleton of the database structure is shown using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagramming method illustrated below. UML's standard notion is still being finalized for global use, and so annotations such as (has-a) to express object composition and (implements) to express inheritance are added to the diagram:

The above structure shows object variables and constructors only. Plus sign (+) indicates public visibility whereas minus sign (-) sets out private scope. 
The Database uses ArrayList to hold the collection of Item's references. 
It contains of a set of overloading/overriding methods to support the object hierarchy assumed in this context. I Implement the hierarchy, populated Database with at least two items per non-abstract class, and showed the "unsorted" and "sorted" list of the set of those instances. I create the database sort based on the lexicographical order of id as well as any combination of data variables. I demonstrate knowledge of object listing and object hierarchy with added methods.
